# Animal-Cruelty-Charges

For this project, I want to analyze trends in animal cruelty charges in Boston over the pat five years. Massachusetts has some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the country, but still more can be done to strengthen regulations.

Reached out to Born Free USA and the DA's office to see what data is available for animal cruelty charges in Mass/Boston.
